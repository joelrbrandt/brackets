    //are supported:
    //- "uglify": (default) uses UglifyJS to minify the code.
    //- "closure": uses Google's Closure Compiler in simple optimization
    //mode to minify the code. Only available if running the optimizer using
    //Java.
    //- "closure.keepLines": Same as closure option, but keeps line returns
    //in the minified files.
    //- "none": no minification will be done.

    //process and give errors on code for ES5 strict mode,
    //and there is a lot of legacy code that will not work in strict mode.
